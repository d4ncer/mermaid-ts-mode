# Major mode for Mermaid using treesit

**WARNING** This is *very* experimental.

Emacs major mode for working with [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) files. It uses the `tree-sitter` grammar defined [here](https://github.com/monaqa/tree-sitter-mermaid).

**NOTE** This requires Emacs 29+ compiled with `tree-sitter` support. [Here is an excellent guide](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/how-to-get-started-tree-sitter) on how to set this up.

## Installation
